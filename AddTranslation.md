# Translate API names and help to improve the tranlsation feature

When using the _Optimize-M365Doc -UseTranslationFiles_ the OData api names will be translated to the labels used in the Microsoft Portals. Some of the documented objects are not translated due to high effort which is needed to do this. But you can help translating them and make the project better for everybody. With the new _Invoke-M365DocTranslationUI_ command this is really simple.
